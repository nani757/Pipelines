# what are Pipelines
pipelines chains together multiple steps so that the output of each step is used as input to the next step 

pipelines make it easy to apply the same preprocessing to train and test!

if you are planning to use Pipeline then 
and if you want to implement a classifier like DecisionTreeClassifier or RandomForestClassifier call (.fit) not (.fit_transform)
if you do not want to use the classifier then (.fit_transform) will perform great
